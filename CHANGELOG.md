CHANGELOG
---------

- **2.0.1 - UNRELEASED**
  - Fix Ruby 1.9.3 support. Do not use `__dir__` because Ruby 1.9.3 does not support it.
- **2.0.0 - July 11, 2018**
  - Change method of applying patches from `require 'rearmed_rails/apply_patches'` to `RearmedRails#apply_patches!`
  - Once `apply_patches!` has been called, then `enabled_patches` cannot be changed. If it is, it will raise a `PatchesAlreadyAppliedError`
  - Allow setting `:all` for `Rearmed#enabled_patches=`
  - Add type checking to `Rearmed#enabled_patches=`
  - Remove support for Rails 3
  - Remove and Extract minitest methods to new gem `minitest-changed-assertions`
  - Remove `ActiveRecord#or` method as it does not always return correct results. Instead use this gem https://github.com/khiav223577/rails_or
  - Remove `ActiveRecord#find_in_relation_batches` and `ActiveRecord#find_relation_each` methods. The reason I implemented these methods was to improve some performance issues I was having. After used this and then later trying some other techniques I can confirm this is a poor technique to improve performance. Therefore I am removing these methods.
